# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple and straightforward single-page Twitter clone.

For this project I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and AJAX for my front end while NodeJs and Express took care of the back end portion of this. The database was simply an object database from memory. 


# Key Features of the Tweeter Project
-Ability to send out tweets straight to the page. 
-Refresh is not required and no redirection will take place. Tweet should appear mere moments later on screen.
-Character counter in place to show how many characters are remaining. Includes checks to make sure tweets are not empty or over the limit.
-Responsive design was implemented to provide a great user experience no matter what device is being used.
